## Non-Negotiable Rules
1) Verifier is authoritative truth plane: deterministic, non-AI, offline, no mutation.
2) AI analyzer is downstream-only: analysis cannot override verifier status.
3) All outputs must be independently checkable and evidence-linked.
4) Test vectors must remain deterministic and reproducible.

## Contributions Welcome
- Verifier implementations (Rust recommended, Python acceptable reference)
- Deterministic canonical JSON tooling
- Additional test vectors + expected outputs
- Documentation improvements
