# Security Policy

## Reporting
If you discover a security vulnerability, please open a private security advisory (preferred) or email the maintainer with:
- Description of issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact analysis
- Suggested fix (if available)

## Principles
- The verifier must remain deterministic and offline-capable.
- No self-healing or mutation of evidence bundles during verification.
- Any remediation or repair must be emitted as a separate artifact with its own evidence.
